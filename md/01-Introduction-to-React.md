### Chapter 1: Introduction to React
- **Overview of React and its Ecosystem**:  
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. React's ecosystem includes tools and libraries such as React Router for routing, Redux for state management, and Next.js for server-side rendering.

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - **Components**: The building blocks of a React application. Components are reusable pieces of UI that can be defined as either class components or functional components.
  - **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize UI components.
  - **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses the virtual DOM to optimize rendering by updating only the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI, leading to improved performance.
